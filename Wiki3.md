## <div align = "center"> Data Types [Kelvin] </div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Data types in C++, like in any other programming language, are essential for defining the kind of data that variables can store and manipulate. They specify the amount of memory to allocate for a variable and the operations that is allowed on the data. C++ includes several built-in types, categorized mainly into primitive and derived types.

### <div align = "center"> Primitive Data Types </div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Primitive Data Types are the basic building blocks of a programming language. They are predefined by the language and represent simple values. They are fixed in size and are directly supported by the underlying hardware. Integer is a primitive data type, which can be represented as ‘int’, ‘short’, ‘long’, ‘long long’, depending on if it is known how big/small the number is. Ideally you want to pick the best fit with the least amount of unused bits in memory to minimize any waste of resources. The same principle follows with Floating-Point Types. Another example would be Character, a type used for single characters to store ASCII values.

### <div align = "center"> Derived Data Types </div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Derived Data Types are constructed from primitive data types and allow more complex data structures and abstractions. Our first example will be Arrays, a collection of elements of the same data type that can be accessed via indices. Essentially, arrays facilitate handling multiple related data items as one and they require contiguous memory allocation. Another derived data type would be Pointers, variables that store memory addresses. They are crucial for dynamic memory allocation and the fundamental pieces to complex data structures like Linked Lists & Trees.

Understanding C++ data types is crucial for efficient memory usage and error-free programming. Choosing the appropriate data type ensures optimal performance and resource management in software applications.

## <div align = "center"> Statement-Level Control Structures [Kelvin] </div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Statement-Level Control Structures in C++ are vital for directing the flow of program execution. They allow for conditional operations, repeated execution, and branching, making programs more dynamic and responsive.

### <div align = "center"> Conditional Statements </div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conditional statements, include “if-else if/else” statements which execute code blocks based on Boolean expressions. They are effectively enabling decision-making processes within programs. Another conditional would be a “switch”. A switch statement selects one out of all the code blocks to execute, based on the value of an expression. It is efficient for handling multiple conditions.

### <div align = "center"> Looping Constructs </div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Looping constructs enable repeated execution of code blocks. An example, the “for Loop” is ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations is known beforehand. Another example, the “while Loop” repeats a block of code as long as the specified condition remains true, which is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

### <div align = "center"> Jump Statements </div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jump statements alter the normal flow of control. The “break” statement exits a loop or “switch” statement prematurely. The “continue” statement skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds with the next. The “goto” statement transfers control to a labeled statement, though its use is generally discouraged due to readability concerns.

<br/>
Mastering control structures is essential for implementing logic and creating flexible, robust programs. They allow programmers to handle various scenarios and conditions, ensuring the program behaves as expected under different circumstances.

### <div align = "center"> Abstract Data Types
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C++ excels at defining custom data structures through its support for classes, allowing developers to create clear interfaces and hidden implementations for their data.  For programmers to create these clear interfaces by using abstract data types and encapsulation. Abstract Data Types (ADT’s) are data types that represent a concept rather than an object. C++ supports the creation of abstract data types by using a function known as pure virtual function. Pure virtual functions are functions that must be overridden within a new class called a derived class.  In C++ a program can implement multiple virtual functions depending on what the programmer needs. However, pure virtual functions must always be overridden within the derived class and the class that contains these functions cannot be created into objects rather its purpose is to be called within the derived class.

### <div align = "center"> Encapsulation </div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (Which will be discussed in the section below.) and is well-supported in C++. Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single class. The primary goals of encapsulation are to protect the internal state of an object from unintended interference and to provide a clear interface for interacting with that object. Encapsulation provides many benefits such as data hiding, modularity, and maintenance. Data hiding protects data by restricting access to the internal state of an object. Modularity allows for different parts of a program to be developed, tested, and maintained independently from the rest of the code. Maintenance in encapsulated code allows for the programmer to change and rearrange code internally without causing issues outside of that specific code.
 
In C++ encapsulated code can be found using 3 types of entities called private, protected, and public clauses. Private clauses allow for their respected objects to be specifically available within the class itself, these objects cannot be changed or modified outside their dedicated classes. Protected clause objects are available within their own classes and any of the derived classes (also known as subclasses) that include these protected objects. Public clauses are accessible from anywhere throughout the program where the objects are available.

Like other programming languages that allow for encapsulation, C++ can create constructor methods in class definitions. Constructor methods are functions or methods that initialize data members of newly created objects. In C++ these constructor methods can also be implemented for allocation of heap-dynamic data that contain references to pointers in the newly created object. Due to C++’s ability to allocate memory, the program language can also implement destructor methods that allow for deallocating heap memory that is referenced by objects that no longer exist. These methods may also be used to record the state of an object before it ceases to exist.


## <div align = "center"> Object-Oriented Programming [Tamara] </div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In contrast to its base language C, C++ distinguishes itself through its structure, which is shaped by the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming concept that focuses on objects in the form of data fields and code in the form of methods or procedures. OOP objects are typically instances of classes that define the structure and behavior of objects. A programming language that uses OOP must support three key features. These features are abstract data types, inheritance, and dynamic binding of method calls. C++ has a unique mix of OOP and class systems based on SIMULA 67. Along with allowing for backward combability in the C language, Making C++ a hybrid language of procedural programming and OOP. C++ can contain objects that are static, stack dynamic, and heap dynamic. However, because C does not have implicit storage allocation, heap dynamics must be reallocated to prevent memory leaks.

C++ can contain objects that are static, stack dynamic, and heap dynamic. However, because C does not have implicit storage allocation, heap dynamics must be reallocated to prevent memory leaks. Due to these memory leaks, many C++ classes tend to also implement destructor methods that allow for deallocating heap memory that is referenced by objects that no longer exist. These methods may also be used to record the state of an object before it ceases to exist.

### <div align = "center"> Inheritance  </div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since C++ is based around OOP, it allows for the use of inheritance to define relationships between classes. Inheritance is a fundamental structure within OOP that allows a newly created class (known as a derived class.) to inherit attributes and methods from an already existing class (known as a base class). Meaning that the derived class can reuse code from the base class, which reduces the redundancy and reusability of previous code. C++ classes can either be stand-alone without the need for inheritance or can have multiple references to base classes using multiple inheritance. However, C++ objects must be initialized before they are used, meaning that all C++ classes must include a constructor method that initializes all data fields. These constructor methods must be called when initiating an object within a base class or superclass.
    
        Example of C++ Inheritance:
            drieved_class(subclass parameters) : public base_class(superclass parameters){
            // Code for subclass is listed here that can call for methods within the base class.
        }
